# Complete Deep Dive: 3D Reconstruction System

## Part 1: System Architecture & Core Technologies

---

### 1.1 What This System Does

This is an **AI-powered 3D reconstruction application** that converts a single 2D image into a complete 3D model. The system uses:
- Deep learning (neural networks)
- Computer vision
- 3D graphics rendering
- Web technologies

**Input:** A single 2D photo (e.g., chair.jpg)

**Output:**
- `mesh.obj` - 3D geometry file (OBJ format)
- `mesh.stl` - 3D printing format (STL format)
- `mesh.mtl` - Material definition file
- `mesh_texture.png` - Texture/color map
- `render.mp4` - 360° rotation video
- `render_000.png` to `render_029.png` - 30 individual frames
- Interactive WebGL viewer in browser
